### [Demo]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld]

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Wesib]** including 
CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Wesib]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld] repo.
